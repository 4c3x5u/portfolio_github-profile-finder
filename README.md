# GitHub Finder — User and Content Search
![GitHub Finder – UI Screenshot](https://i.ibb.co/1LnK0C8/Screenshot-2021-05-04-at-15-17-15.png)

## Aim and Purpose
I have developed this application to demonstrate **my ability to incorporate third-party APIs into my own apps** by 
using the authentication methods that are required by those APIs, and thereby **creating bespoke clients that serve as 
an interaction layer for other applications**. The result is a React app that consumes two different APIs (GitHub
Search and OpenStreetMap) to search and load GitHub profiles as the user types into the search box. It also allows 
the browsing of each loaded profile's *repos*, *gists*, *followers*, *following*, and *location* right within the page.

## Running the App
### Requirements
1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) or [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
   
### Instructions
1. Open up a terminal and make sure you are inside the root folder of the project.
2. Install dependencies.
    - `yarn install` or `npm install`
2. Run the app.
    - `yarn start` or `npm start`
   
That's it! The application must now be running at *http://localhost:3000*. Navigate to this address in a browser to
load the app.
